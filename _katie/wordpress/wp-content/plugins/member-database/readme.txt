Maintain membership information for your club or association.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to manage a database of membership info for your club or association. You can add, edit, list, and delete members from the database, as well as export the membership information as a .csv file, which lets you import the data into a spreadsheet.

== Installation ==

* Upload to a directory named "member-database" in your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
* Activate the plugin using the 'Plugins' menu in your site's admin dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do members automatically become WordPress users? =

No. That feature will be included in a future version.

= What format should I use for importing dates? =

This plugin uses the standard (ISO 8601) yyyy-mm-dd format. Make sure that the dates in your .csv file are in that format.
